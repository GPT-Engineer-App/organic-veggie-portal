# organic-veggie-portal

Create a website using the CodeIgniter 4.0 framework, MySQL and Bootstrap about organic vegetable plants, on the main page there are images of organic plant products in Pinterest style and add an infinity function for auto scrolling when the user wants to see more organic products. Below each image there is a like icon with the number of likes and number of comments. Users can give likes and comments and the number is immediately saved into the database. Then add an add to cart icon if the user wants to buy a certain product. The image with the most likes or comments will be at the top. Add Home, About, contact us links. Then add login/logout links for users with various user level groups with certain access rights on the web page. Also add CRUD function to add organic vegetable products. All data input/output functions must include the best security functions. Thank You.
